# CS50 Introduction to Computer Science

Welcome to my CS50 repository! This repository contains all the code and projects I have completed as part of Harvard's CS50 course.

### About CS50

CS50 is Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. The course covers fundamental programming concepts, algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques, using languages such as C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript.

### Repository Structure

This repository is organized based on the problem sets and projects from the CS50 curriculum:

Week 0 - Scratch Project

Week 1 - C Basics, Conditionals, Loops

Week 2 - Arrays, Functions, Strings

Week 3 - Algorithms, Sorting, Searching

Week 4 - Memory, Pointers, Recursion

Week 5 - Data Structures (Linked Lists, Hash Tables, Tries)

Week 6 - Python Programming

Week 7 - SQL and Databases

Week 8 - Web Development with Flask

Final Project - A custom project applying CS50 concepts

### How to Use This Repository

If you're also taking CS50 or just want to explore the course material, feel free to clone this repository and review the code:

git clone https://github.com/lettymoon/cs50-repository.git

### Running the Code

Some projects require a C compiler or Python environment. 

#### For C programs, you can use gcc:
``` bash
gcc filename.c -o filename
./filename
```

For Python scripts:
``` bash
python3 filename.py
```
